Release Notes for Methylation Plugin


# Version 3.1.0 - Aug 8, 2017

- added HTML style methylation tracks
    - each feature is now a html div element not painted to the canvas
    - this will be beneficial for screenshots since html div elements are editable in pdf/svg format

# Version 3.0.3 - Aug 2, 2017
- minor bug fix with methylated option checkbox not being destroyed on chrm change

# Version 3.0.2 - Jul 13, 2017

# Version 3.0.1 - Jun 20, 2017
- Changed default of MethylPlot to only show methylated positions by default
- Added print statement to plugin constructor

# Version 3.0.0 - Jun 19, 2017

- Updated MethylPlot with a "ShowMethylatedOnly" option, when checked, it only shows "methylated" sites
    - Methylated sites are determined by the value in the bigwig file
    - Methylated sites have "1" in the 7th decimal position; unmethylated sites have "0"
    - This only works when bigwig files have been converted using `allc_to_bigwig_pe_v3.py" option
    - When this option is used for bigwig files converted with a different script, results will be incorrect.
- For tracks converted with "allc_to_bigwig_pe_v3.py", use the "methylatedOption = true" in the configuration file.
- Also updated to score mouseover score values are only shown for visible sites
