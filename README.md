# Methylation Plugin
This is a JBrowse plugin
 
This plugin is to be used with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data. Unlike almost all other browsers, this plugin allows you to see all methylation contexts on one track

## Install

For JBrowse 1.11.6+ in the _JBrowse/plugins_ folder, type:  
``git clone https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-methylation.git MethylationPlugin``

**or**

downloaded the latest release version at [releases](https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-methylation/releases).  
Unzip the downloaded folder, place in _JBrowse/plugins_, and rename the folder _MethylationPlugin_

## Activate
Add this to _jbrowse.conf_ under `[GENERAL]`:

    [ plugins.MethylationPlugin ]
    location = plugins/MethylationPlugin

If that doesn't work, add this to _jbrowse_conf.json_:

    "plugins" : {
        "MethylationPlugin" : { "location" : "plugins/MethylationPlugin" }
    }

## Test
Sample data is included in the plugin to test that the plugin is working properly. With `URL` as the URL path to the JBrowse instance, navigate a web browser to `URL/index.html?data=plugins/MethylationPlugin/test/data`.

## Using Methylation Tracks
### Versions
- Previous versions are supported for backwards compatability but using the current version (v3) is suggested.
- **Version 1*** is when all contexts are in a single BigWig file
    - This caused problems with zooming in the browser, so version 2 was developed as a fix.
    - Version 1 is still supported, but not recommended for use.
- **Version 2** uses three BigWig files, one for each methylation context.
    - The files need the same base name, like _my-file.bw_, and contexts are specified as additional extensions, i.e. _my-file.bw.cg_, _my-file.bw.chg_, and _my-file.bw.chh_.
    - Visualization greatly depends on if the `-all` parameter is used when converting the raw allC/bismark file
- **Version 3** corrects the confusion about visualizating all sites vs methylated sites only
    - Similar to version 2 in that there are 3 BigWig files (one for each context)
    - Includes support to be able to filter use all or only methylated sites within one track. This keeps the global view looking good when zoomed out but allows for better visualization when zoomed in.
- Even for animals, who are interested in CG and CH, use the three contexts specified here. CHG and CHH are combined by the plugin to form CH context.

### HTML-style Track
- Using the HTML-style track is not recommended because it can be slow for large regions and/or lots of data.
- However, HTML-style tracks are preferred when taking screenshots. 
  - The default methyl track type paints the basepair methylation (feature) on a HTML `canvas` element.
  - That's great for speed but is exported as an uneditable image.
  - In the HTML-style tracks,  each base (feature) is exported as an editable HTML `div` element
-  It is recommended you add all tracks as version 3 tracks and _only_ use HTML-style tracks when taking screenshots. 
See this [JBrowse plugin](https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-screenshot.git) which makes taking screenshots easy and is configured to work with this methylation plugin.
- **Note**: The HTML-style track does allow for hiding/showing context and "methylated positions only" but does not support min and max score changes (default min: -1, max: 1).

### File Conversion
The methylation tracks works best when the data is stored as BigWig file(s). File conversion is easy, though. Use the conversion program appropriate to your input file type. 
_bedGraphToBigWig_ and _bedSort_ (programs from UCSC) must be on your path. See details below for acquiring this program.  
#### allC Files
- allC files have these columns: chr, pos, strand, mc_class, mc_count, total, methylated
- In v2, by default, only _methylated_ positions are included. Use the `-all` option to include all non-zero positions.
- In v3, all non-zero positions are included. Methylated/unmethylated positions are denoted by the value.
- All chromosomes need to be combined into one allC file.
- You also need a file with chromosome sizes. This file should be tab-delimitated, one chromosome per line, with at least chromosome name and chromosome size. The genome's FASTA index (.fa.fai) file works well.
- For a given genome (i.e. chromosome sizes), you can specify an unlimited number of allC files to be converted. 
- Note: version 1 conversion renames reference sequences to a convention while version 2 does not.
- Conversion Version 1:

```
Usage: python3 allc_old_bigwig_pe.py [-keep] [-no-clean] [-sort] [-all] 
       [-L=labels] [-p=num_proc] <chrm_sizes>  <allC_file> [allC_file]*  
-keep           when on, keeps temporary files
-no-clean       does not check chromosome names match chrm file
-sort           calls bedSort; add this option if bigwig conversion fails
-all            use all positions with methylation not just methylated ones
-L=labels       comma-separated list of labels for incoming allC files  
-p=num_proc     number of processors to use [default 1]  
-o=outID        optional string to include in output file names
```

* Conversion Version 2:
```
Usage: python3 allc_to_bigwig_pe.py [-keep] [-sort] [-all] [-L=labels] 
       [-o=out_id] [-p=num_proc]<chrm_sizes>  <allC_file> [allC_file]*
-keep        keep intermediate files
-sort        calls bedSort; add this option if bigwig conversion fails
-all         use all positions with methylation [default methylated sites]
-allz        use all positions with coverage including 0's
-L=labels    comma-separated list of labels to use for the allC files;
             defaults to using information from the allc file name
-o=out_id    optional identifier to be added to the output file names
-p=num_proc  number of processors to use [default 1]
```
* Conversion Version 3:
```
Usage:  python3 allc_to_bigwig_pe_v3.py [-keep] [-sort] [-L=labels] [-p=num_proc]
        [-o=out_id] <chrm_sizes> <allC_file> [allC_file]*
-keep        keep intermediate files
-sort        calls bedSort; add this option if bigwig conversion fails
-L=labels    comma-separated list of labels to use for the allC files;
             defaults to using information from the allc file name
-o=out_id    optional identifier to be added to the output file names
-p=num_proc  number of processors to use [default 1]
```

#### Bismark
* Bismark files have the following columns: chr, pos, strand, methylated reads, total reads, C context, trinucleotide context
* There is a script to convert bismark files to version 2 and 3
* *Note*: for v3, when filtering for methylated sites only, any site with at least 1 methylated read is considered "methylated"

* Conversion Version 2
```
Usage:  python3 bismark_to_bigwig_pe.py [-keep] [-sort] [-all] [-L=labels] 
        [-o=out_id] [-p=num_proc] <chrm_sizes>  <bismark_file> [bismark_file]*
-keep        keep intermediate files
-sort        calls bedSort; add this option if bigwig conversion fails
-all         use all covered positions including 0s [default only includes mC > 1]
-L=labels    comma-separated list of labels to use for the allC files;
             defaults to using information from the allc file name
-o=out_id    optional identifier to be added to the output file names
-p=num_proc  number of processors to use [default 1]
```

* Conversion Version 3
```
Usage:  python3 bismark_to_bigwig_pe_v3.py [-keep] [-sort] [-L=labels] [-o=out_id]
        [-p=num_proc] <chrm_sizes>  <bismark_file> [bismark_file]*
-keep        keep intermediate files
-sort        calls bedSort; add this option if bigwig conversion fails
-L=labels    comma-separated list of labels to use for the allC files;
             defaults to using information from the allc file name
-o=out_id    optional identifier to be added to the output file names
-p=num_proc  number of processors to use [default 1]
```

### JSON Track Specifications
Track specifications are very similar to those for XYPlots (see JBrowse tutorial for more information). The _label_, _type_, and _urlTemplate_ must be specified. 

#### Version 1
```
{  
  "key" : "Wild Type Methylation",
  "label" : "track_wild_type_methylation",
  "style" : { "height" : 50 },
  "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BigWig",
  "urlTemplate" : "path/to/bigwig_file.bw",
  "type" : "MethylationPlugin/View/Track/Wiggle/MethylXYPlot"
}
```
    
#### Version 2

_urlTemplate_ is the path and filename up-to, but not including, the context-specific extension. For example `"urlTemplate" : "path/my-file.bw"` from example above.
```
{  
  "key" : "Wild Type Methylation",
  "label" : "track_wild_type_methylation",
  "style" : { "height" : 50 },
  "storeClass" : "MethylationPlugin/Store/SeqFeature/MethylBigWig",
  "urlTemplate" : "path/to/bigwig_file.bw",
  "type" : "MethylationPlugin/View/Track/Wiggle/MethylPlot"
}
```
If there is not a file for all contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH), include the following in the track configuration and specify only the contexts needed. 

```
 "contexts" : ["cg", "chh"]
```

#### Version 3

Same as Version 2 except add this to configuration
```
"methylatedOption" : true
```

#### HTML-Style
```
{
  "type" : "MethylationPlugin/View/Track/MethylHTMLPlot",
  "urlTemplate" : "line1-G3-rep1_Chr5_short.bw",
  "category" : "Test data",
  "maxHeight": 100,
  "key" : "WT HTML Methylation",
  "storeClass" : "MethylationPlugin/Store/SeqFeature/MethylBigWig",
  "label" : "track_html_methylation"
}
```

    
### Animal-specific coloring
While the plant world likes methylation broken into CG, CHG, and CHH, the animal world prefers CG and CH. For those only interested in CG, ignore this and be sure to specify only the CG context in the configuration (see above).

Using the animal coloring scheme is enforced hierarchically. Configurations specified at a higher level overpower lower-level specification. If not specified at a specific level, inherits the setting of the level below. 

| level| location | syntax|
|--|--|--|
|*highest* | individual track config | `isAnimal=true` |
| | `tracks.conf` | `[general]`<br>`isAnimal=true` |
| | `jbrowse.conf` | `[general]` <br> `isAnimal=true` |
|*lowest*| **default** | `isAnimal=false`|

Note that toolbar buttons are defined by `tracks.conf` and `jbrowse.conf`.

## Future Plans
- corrected global statistics
- improved documentation for the different versions
- Complimentary track style with HTML features, which will be useful for screenshots
