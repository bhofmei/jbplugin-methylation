## [v3.0.1] - 2017-06-20
- Changed default of MethylPlot to only show methylated positions by default
- Added print statement to plugin constructor

## [v3.0.0] - 2017-06-19
- Updated MethylPlot with a "ShowMethylatedOnly" option, when checked, it only shows "methylated" sites
    - Methylated sites are determined by the value in the bigwig file
    - Methylated sites have "1" in the 7th decimal position; unmethylated sites have "0"
    - This only works when bigwig files have been converted using `allc_to_bigwig_pe_v3.py` option
    - When this option is used for bigwig files converted with a different script, results will be incorrect.
- For tracks converted with "allc_to_bigwig_pe_v3.py", use the "methylatedOption = true" in the configuration file.
- Also updated to score mouseover score values are only shown for visible sites

## [v2.2.0] - 2016-08-03
- MethylBigWig uses lowest common zoom level between the contexts of the same track
  - previously, contexts could appear very different at certain zooms because they had different number of zoom levels

## [v2.1.2] - 2016-07-22
- showCG, showCHG, showCHH are part of default configs

  - necessary when not all (CG, CHG, CHH) are present

  - if not specified and file is missing, error is displayed on screen rather than ignoring the context
